# Advent of Code

### Aim
The aim of this project is to recreate [this](https://zero-to-mastery.github.io/zero-to-mastery-website/events/advent-of-code.html) in react ready for the 1st Dec 2019

### Complexity
Due to the time constraints, we should start by nailing the core must have functionality in a simple yet elegant mannor. Most of the project is up for discussion/negotiation, so if you have an idea... pitch it, if it makes things simpler or shows clear value to using it, its well worth considering. 

### Design
We haven't had time to come up with a design and I don't want to delay the project further while this is completed. So lets roll with a base of the old one. Feel free to be creative as you are building out components, but again keep it simple, elegant and easy for the next person to continue the design system. Also make sure your changes are relected everywhere they appear, so we don't end up with inconsistancies. 

### Submission Flow
Last year users submitted thier solutions via commands in the discord server. This seemed to confused a few people. 
This year we would like to provide a form on the website people can use to send their submission. This is roughly what should happen:

1. User clicks on `Submit Solution`
2. User authenticates with Discord OAuth (We could session this to save them doing it every time)
3. User is presented with a form to specify which day the solution is for, and the Repl.it URL
4. On submission the bot will save it to the DB and update embeds in the AOC channel.

### Trello
 - Feel free to pick up any task in `Backlog` and move it to `In Progress`, assign it to yourself so everyone knows who is working on it
 - If you cant complete the task, create a PR with what you have and update the trello card and place back in backlog. Please ping Matt or Ankur, just so we are aware and can take action if its a blocker
 - Creating tasks - If we have missed anything, feel free to create one in the `Needs Grooming` section. We can then validate and specify its requirements and release it to backlog
